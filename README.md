To run the server for your Windows Forms application with an Express backend, follow these steps:

### Setting Up the Server
1. **Install Node.js:** If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Clone the Repository:** Clone your project repository that contains the Express backend and the Windows Forms application.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Navigate to the backend directory in your terminal and install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Server:** Start the Express server by running:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Windows Forms Application
1. **Open the Windows Forms Application:** Open your Windows Forms application project in Visual Studio.

2. **Update the API Endpoint:** Make sure the API endpoint in your Windows Forms application points to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. **Run the Application:** Start debugging or run your Windows Forms application. It should connect to the Express backend running on `http://localhost:3000` and display the form.

### Additional Notes
- Ensure that your `db.json` file is correctly located and structured to store the submissions.
- Update the API endpoints in your Windows Forms application if you modify the routes in your Express backend.

### Example Repository Structure
Here's an example repository structure for your project:
```
project/
├── backend/
│   ├── db.json
│   ├── node_modules/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── server.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── package.json
│   └── ...
├── windows-forms-app/
│   ├── Form1.cs
│   ├── Program.cs
│   └── ...
└── README.md
```

### Example `package.json` (Backend)
```json
{
  "name": "express-backend",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "src/server.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node src/server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "body-parser": "^1.19.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "fs": "^0.0.1-security",
    "path": "^0.12.7"
  }
}
```
